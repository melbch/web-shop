Dragons—long believed to be extinct—have returned with terrifying force, razing towns to ash and unraveling centuries of fragile peace.\n\nThe last line of defense is the Order of the Flame, an elite brotherhood of warriors who wield ancient weapons forged in celestial fire.

Vengeance fuels his sword arm, but when a battle uncovers evidence that the dragons' reawakening is no accident, Ronan realizes the firestorm is far more than a natural disaster.\n\nA forgotten prophecy, a corrupted lineage, and the whispers of an ancient power point to a truth darker than war itself. As Ronan and his comrades push deeper into enemy territory, alliances are tested, secrets are unearthed, and the true enemy begins to emerge—not all of them wearing scales.\n\nWith time running out and the fate of Drakara at stake, Ronan must face his greatest fear: that the war he's been fighting isn't the one that needs to be won.\n\nConquest of Flames is an epic fantasy saga full of action, sacrifice, and the fierce heart of a warrior who dares to challenge destiny.",
